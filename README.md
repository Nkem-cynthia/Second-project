### Project Overview
The management of WixSin Company required a comprehensive analysis of their sales data to support revenue optimization. As the assigned Data Analyst, I was tasked to consolidate multiple datasets and building a professional, interactive Excel dashboard that reveals key business insights. The goal was to identify trends, top-performing products, and customer segments to inform strategic decisions.

### Challenges
| Challenges | Solution |
|----------- | -------- |
| While trying to copy the Sum of Revenue from the PivotTable to the dashboard, the value wouldnâ€™t appear, even after using the GETPIVOTDATA function and keyboard shortcuts. | After troubleshooting, I discovered the issue was caused by a background shape covering the cell. Once I removed the shape, the data appeared correctly and the KPI card updated as expected.|
